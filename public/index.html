      <h3><span class="math">P<sub>n</sub> = 1 - (1 - P<sub>1</sub>)<sup>n</sup></span></h3>
      <p>
        <span class="math">P<sub>1</sub></span> is the probability that a random person who might be in a group is COVID-19+.
        <span class="math">1 - P<sub>1</sub></span> is the probability that said random person is not COVID-19+.
        <span class="math">(1 - P<sub>1</sub>)<sup>n</sup></span> is the probability that <span class="math">n</span> random people are all not COVID-19+.
        <span class="math">P<sub>n</sub></span> is the probability that there is one of <span class="math">n</span> random people who is COVID-19+.
        It's a little bit simplistic, so probably not terribly predictive.
        But I'm using this to figure out which sizes of groups are OK to participate in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming up with <span class="math">P<sub>1</sub></span> is a challenge.
        I've chosen to make it <span class="math">i / N</span>, where <span class="math">N</span> is the population and <span class="math">i</span> is a guess at the number of people who are contagious and not staying home.
        I have set <span class="math">i = C c<sub>7</sub></span>, where <span class="math">c<sub>7</sub></span> is the number of new cases in the last week.
        My assumption here is that the circulating contagious people are mostly those who are about to develop symptoms, and that anyone who has tested positive is quarantined.
        I made <span class="math">C = 2</span> as a somewhat random guess.
        It's greater than one to account for undetected cases.
        Another thing that affects <span class="math">C</span> is under-testing.
      </p>
      <h3>How to use this?</h3>
      <p>
        Primarily, this useful for comparing the relative risk of going out in communities with similar cultures (in other words, where testing and reporting are likely to be similar).
        I'm using it to gauge whether it's safe to go to events that involve a lot of people: a group of friends, church, classes.
        There are lots of other factors, too.
        Is it indoors or outdoors?
        Will it be crowded or spaced out?
        Will people be talking to each other?
        Will people be talking to each other briefly or for a long time?
        Will everyone be singing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Make <span class="math">C</span> bigger or smaller based on whether you think the last week's new case count is close to accurate (1) or too small (&gt;=2).
      </p>
      <p>
        Make <span class="math">P<sub>n</sub></span> the percent probability you're comfortable with, and it'll show you the maximum group size you should be in.
        The default is 5% (one in twenty chance of a COVID-19+ individual at an event).

      <h3>Returning to normal</h3>
      <p>
        As things open back up and we go back to "normal", I've been trying
        to figure out how likely it is that there will be infected people
        at any particular gathering. This is most important for places
        where we spend a bunch of time or talk to a bunch of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything we do is a balance between risk and reward. COVID-19 has
        changed the level of risk, which means we might not choose to do
        all of the same things we chose to do in the past.
