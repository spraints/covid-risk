      <h3>My model of COVID-19 risk</h3>
      <p>
        In college, I wasn't expecting to like my Probability class. The
        professor was kind of goofy. But I really liked how we were able
        to predict things more accurately than by using intuition. The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday
        problem</a> is perhaps the most memorable of these things. We
        also talked about some space disasters and how, if you did the
        math correctly, it would have been less surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main insight that I gained is that, even when a particular
        occurence is very unlikely, when you put it in a group the
        probability might go up much faster than you expect. Applied
        to our current situation, even though it's very unlikely that
        you'll run into an individual person with COVID-19, you would
        need a surprisingly small number of people in the same place
        to have at least one person who's infected.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page has a model where you can choose a locality and a risk
        tolerance and see the largest group size you should be a part of.
        Remember that it's just a model. It's most useful in giving you
        a picture of how much different the risk level is between, say,
        a group of 10 and a group of 100. It's not scientifically
        rigorous. It's how my very dusty memory of probability is
        processing things today. It also deals with probabilities, which
        are much better at predicting things across an entire population
        than for a particular individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formula I'm using is <i>P<sub>n</sub> = 1 - (1 - p)<sup>n</sup></i>.
        <i>p</i> is the probability that a random individual you meet is
        infected. <i>n</i> is the group size. <i>P<sub>n</sub></i> is the
        probability that someone in a group of <i>n</i> is infected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming up with <i>p</i> is a challenge. I've chosen to make it
        <i>i N<sup>-1</sup></i>, where <i>N</i> is the population and
        <i>i</i> is a guess at the number of people who are contagious
        and still circulating. I have set <i>i = C c<sub>7</sub></i>,
        where <i>c<sub>7</sub></i> is the number of new cases in the last
        week. My assumption here is that the circulating contagious
        people are mostly those who are about to develop symptoms, and
        that anyone who has tested positive is quarantined. <i>C = 2</i>,
        to account for undetected cases.

      <h3>Returning to normal</h3>
      <p>
        As things open back up and we go back to "normal", I've been trying
        to figure out how likely it is that there will be infected people
        at any particular gathering. This is most important for places
        where we spend a bunch of time or talk to a bunch of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything we do is a balance between risk and reward. COVID-19 has
        changed the level of risk, which means we might not choose to do
        all of the same things we chose to do in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is my attempt to explore the risk that COVID-19 introduces
        to gatherings. It's not perfect, but it's how I'm working through
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, the ideal scenario would have been that, in March, the
        US stayed at home and reduced the rate of infection to the point
        where, now, we'd be able to go back to doing almost everything with
        really minimal risk. Let's call that a squished curve. A do nothing
        approach would have been an uncontrolled exponential curve, which
        would have been a disaster. What we did flattened the curve, but
        it's made it so that the disease will be around for much longer.
        I anticipate the second half of 2020 will see a split between
        countries with squished curves and flattened curves, and much less
        commerce between those two sets of countries.
